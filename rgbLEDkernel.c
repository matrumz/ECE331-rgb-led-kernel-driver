 * This file contains the source code for ECE 331 Project #1.
 * This is a kernel module that interfaces with the RGB LED on Sheaff's 
 * RPi function generator expansion board.
 * It allows one or more processes to open the RGB LED device special file 
 * but only one process at a time should write to the GPIO pins while 
 * completing the 11 bit data write pattern to the RGB LED. 
 * Should a process open the device special file read/write or read only, it
 * receives an appropriate error. (The RGB LED is a write only device). 
 * The driver auto-magically creates the device special file with 
 * appropriate permissions.
